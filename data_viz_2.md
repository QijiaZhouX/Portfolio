# Part 2
This is a Flourish line chart. Using the grid of charts, we can see the debt to DFP ratio change over time for each country. The x-axis is the debt to GDP ratio, and the y-axis the different years from 1995 to 2022.

# Part 3
This is a scatter plot for the top 10 countries with the highest mean of debt to GDP from 1995 to 2022. The y-axis is the timeline, from year 1995 to 2022, the axis is each country in the top ten list. The dot size and the color represent the value for the debt to GDP ratio; the larger dot means a lager value, as well as a darker color. I selected the top 10 list with the highest mean and created a new CSV file for this. The aim is to make the audience focus on the country with a high debt to GDP first.
